# DCGAN

Modifed version of the DCGAN from: https://arxiv.org/abs/1511.06434.
Training on a subset of the CheXpert dataset (https://stanfordmlgroup.github.io/competitions/chexpert/)
Only using AP chest x-rays labeled "Pneumothorax".

Pulled ACGAN from https://arxiv.org/ftp/arxiv/papers/2103/2103.05094.pdf. Also using CheXpert right now. Need to run the generateCXR to genate images after the model is trained. Uploaded some of weights. Requires normal and abnormal labels and modified directory structure.
