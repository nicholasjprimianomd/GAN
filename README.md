# DCGAN

Modifed version of the DCGAN from: https://arxiv.org/abs/1511.06434.
Training on a subset of the CheXpert dataset.
Only using AP chest x-rays labeled "Pneumothorax"

The commented architecture is adopted from: https://www.researchgate.net/publication/348138774_Evaluation_of_Deep_Convolutional_Generative_Adversarial_Networks_for_Data_Augmentation_of_Chest_X-ray_Images.
It yeilds worse results.
